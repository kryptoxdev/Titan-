Titan+ Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 15/12/2024
This Privacy Policy explains how Titan+ collects, uses, and discloses information through the chrome extension.

Information We Collect
* Titan+ temporarily stores the IMEI number of scanned products on Titan (limited to the current session).
* Titan+ also stores a list of up to 5 recently "processed" IMEIs locally on your device to track the number of devices processed within Titan.
* The scanned IMEI is used to check if a product's video upload status needs to be displayed on Titan. Titan+ does not transmit this data or the video upload status to any remote servers.
* Titan+ stores user-defined counter values through Chrome's storage.sync API. These values are specific to the Titan+ extension and are not used for any other purpose.
 
How We Use Your Information
* The extension may access and process information related to your use of specific pages on Titan with the extension active. This could include product information, trade-in values, or other content specific to your interaction with the Titan website. This information is used solely to provide the extension's functionalities within Titan.
* The scanned IMEI is used to update the video upload status for the corresponding product within the Titan website (on the same tab).
* The list of recently processed IMEIs is used internally to track the number of devices a user has processed or salesforced within Titan.
* User-defined Counter Values are used to maintain the state of your counters within the extension.
 
Data Storage
* Chrome's storage.sync: Stores user-defined counter values (no size limit specified by Chrome, but there is an approximate quota of 100 KB). Stores a list of up to 5 recently processed IMEIs.
* Chrome's storage.local: Temporarily stores the IMEI of the scanned product during the current browser session.
* Chrome's sessionStorage: Temporarily stores the selected button state within the extension's popup window in order to navigate the extension. This data is lost when you close the popup or your browser window.
 
Your Rights
* You can control how Titan+ accesses website data by disabling the extension in Chrome and disabling certain features within the extension
* You can clear Titan+ storage data through Chrome's settings menu (this will clear user-defined counter values and the list of recently processed IMEIs).
 
Data Security
* We do not collect any personal information through the extension. The limited data stored locally on your device is not accessible to us and can be cleared at any point.
 
Changes to This Privacy Policy
* We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy at this website.
